# What is MongoDB? 
MongoDB is a free open-source document database that uzilizes NoSQL. It stores data in JSON-like format to increase efficiency and to also support more types of data.

### Benefits of using MongoDB
- Its free!!!
- Great for scaling horizontally
- Architecture can support huge volumes of both data and traffic
- Can support many data types 

### Prerequisits 
Before establishing/configuring a connection in your node.js app, be sure that you installed MongoDB into your system and that it is running! Without installation, it will refuse to establish a connection.

### Step: 1 - installing mongodb package
The first step to installing mongodb into node.js is to download the dependencies and drivers using npm (Node Package Manager) run the command `npm install mongodb` in where your package.json file is located.

### Step: 2 - create a database
Next step is to create a new js file and use put this into the file.

### Step: 3 - run the js file!
Now you run the js file that you created by 
`node database.js` 

Next it should prompt you that the database has been created! 

### Step: 4 - create a collection
Now, that is set up go ahead and add these commands to the js file

### Step: 5 - checking db
Finally, to check if the db has been created check through the mongo shell by running the command `mongo --shell` in the terminal.

Next run `show dbs`

Then the databases created should show, and a database named mydb should be present.

And there you go you created and connected a database into your node.js app!
