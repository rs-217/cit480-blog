# Node.js
![Node.JS logo](/cit480-blog/assets/sp-blog-0-node.png)
## Well what is it?
Node.js is used to build back-end environments for web applications. Some great benefits of this technology includes:
- No need to learn a new language just use **JavaScript**!
- Since it uses JavsScript the naming convention can be consistent and have "cleaner" code.
- Great for rapid deployment and prototyping!
- Great for scalability!

Node.js is derived from Google's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code that cannot normally run in a browser. Since both Google Chrome (the web browser) and Node.js use the same engine but they both provide different environments for JavaScript.

In an essence Node.js is **NOT** a framework or a programing language. It is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. In other words Node.js is a server!!!

## What are some Pros and Cons of using Node.js?
**Pros** include:
- Asynchronous/Non-blocking meaning that the program can continue to run without waiting for events.
- Great for data intensive tasks
- Great scalability
- Allows user to write cleaner code
- No need to learn a new language
- Can stream big files

**Cons** include:
- Should not be used for CPU intensive tasks
- User should be already familiar with JavaScript
