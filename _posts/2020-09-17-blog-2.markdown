## Github Basics
# What is Github?
Github is a platform that allows many developers to collaborate their work, provide hosting to software development, as well as offers great version control through various projects. As Github is derived from Git. Many open source projects use Git to keep a history of any changes the project may undergo as Github is designed to make it better to manage these projects.

# Installation 
Here are some helpful links to help install github and git on your windows machine!
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) This link will provide you to install Git along with Git Bash!

# Github commands
Here are some Github commands to help push your next project onto a repository!
[Github Cheat Sheet](https://i.redd.it/8341g68g1v7y.png) Here is a great reference to look through some docker commands!
- `$ git init <project name>` creates a new repository 
- `$ git status` lists new or modded files not yet commited
- `$ git branch` lists all local branches
- `$ git add .` prepares all the files for a commit
- `$ git commit -m "commit message"` commits files to a versioned history
- `$ git push origin <branch name>` synchronizes files to repository at a certain branch
- `$ git --help` when in doubt MAN it out!

# Demo with pictures!
Step 1: `$ git add .`

Step 2: `$ git commit -m "commit message"`

Step 3: `$ git push origin <branch name>`

It should look a little something like this!

Then when we look at our repository online it also shows the commit message we put when we run the command `$ git commit -m "commit message"`.

Keep in mind that the message will only appear to files that have been changed! In this case we added pictures to the assets directory as well as the _posts directory.
